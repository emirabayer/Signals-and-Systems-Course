This lab focused on designing and testing a practical FIR bandpass filter using MATLAB. Key tasks included designing the filter's impulse response, analyzing its frequency response, and applying it to chirp and music signals. The lab involved sampling and reconstructing signals, observing transient and steady-state behavior, and listening to the output signals. Additionally, the lab explored D/A conversion and evaluated the effectiveness of filtering on both music and voice recordings. The MATLAB codes, outputs, and results are provided in the report.
