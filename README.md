## Lab 1 - Investigating Discrete Cosine Signals
Developed MATLAB programs to generate and analyze discrete cosine signals. Tasks included creating finite segments, visualizing graphs with improved styles, quantizing signals, and analyzing periodicity properties. Focused on comparing multiple signals and identifying fundamental periods for a deeper understanding of discrete signal characteristics.

## Lab 2 - Convolution Analysis of Discrete LTI Systems
Implemented explicit convolution procedures for analyzing discrete linear time-invariant systems. Tasks included verifying causality and stability, deriving outputs analytically, and computing numerical convolutions for various input signals. MATLAB programs were used to compare analytical and numerical results, with focus on signal representation and system properties.

## Lab 3 - Simulating Acoustic Environments Using Impulse Responses
Collaborated to capture the impulse response of Odeon by recording the sound of a balloon burst. An anechoic music piece was filtered through this recorded impulse response using MATLAB to simulate how it would sound in the auditorium. Tasks included amplifying music if needed, performing convolution, generating plots for impulse responses and sound segments, and saving results as sound files. The lab report documented the procedure, included visual and audio evidence, and provided analysis on system assumptions, distortions, and acoustic effects on listening quality.

## Lab 4 - Fourier Series and Signal Approximation
This lab involved analyzing Fourier series expansions and signal approximations using MATLAB. Key tasks included discretizing and reconstructing a rectangular waveform, visualizing its spectrum, examining the Gibbs phenomenon, and analyzing harmonic contributions. The study was extended to full-wave and half-wave rectified signals, with MATLAB codes and plots provided.

## Lab 5 - FIR Filter Design and Signal Filtering
This lab focused on designing and testing a practical FIR bandpass filter using MATLAB. Key tasks included designing the filter's impulse response, analyzing its frequency response, and applying it to chirp and music signals. The lab involved sampling and reconstructing signals, observing transient and steady-state behavior, and listening to the output signals. Additionally, the lab explored D/A conversion and evaluated the effectiveness of filtering on both music and voice recordings. The MATLAB codes, outputs, and results are provided in the report.

## Lab 6 - IIR Filter Design
Designed and implemented a bandpass IIR filter in MATLAB, calculated its difference equation, and tested it with chirp signals. Analyzed the filterâ€™s frequency response through plots of impulse response, pole-zero map, and magnitude/phase. Also passed signals through the filter, explored real-time signal processing, and filtered digitized music and voice recordings.
