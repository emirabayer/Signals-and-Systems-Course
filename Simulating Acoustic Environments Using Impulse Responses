Collaborated to capture the impulse response of Odeon by recording the sound of a balloon burst. An anechoic music piece was filtered through this recorded impulse response using MATLAB to simulate how it would sound in the auditorium. Tasks included amplifying music if needed, performing convolution, generating plots for impulse responses and sound segments, and saving results as sound files. The lab report documented the procedure, included visual and audio evidence, and provided analysis on system assumptions, distortions, and acoustic effects on listening quality.
